The goal of this project is to enable pwm control of a brushed DC motor using
the DRV8876 motor driver and Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller. OUpon
successful pwm motor control implementation, the project evolved to test the
effect of pwm frequency on the behavior/performance of the motor. The
different pwm frequencies tested are 20kHz, 30kHz, and 40kHz.
