Initial testing of the DRV8876's current sensing capability showed that
the internal sensor is very noisy (duh). This prompted the use of a low pass
filter to remove the noise from the signal. A digital IIR filter was chosen
as the filter design. The implementation of the IIR is found in iir.h & iir.c.
The motor driver (with filtered current sensing) is found in pwm.c.
