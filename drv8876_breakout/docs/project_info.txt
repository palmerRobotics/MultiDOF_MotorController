The code contained in this directory is designed to test the functionality
of my custorm DRV8876 breakout board. This code is written to run on the 
Raspberry Pi Pico. This goal of this project is to learn how to write a brushed
DC motor driver using the DRV8876, which will later be used with the 
PIC32MK.
